# lda.jl
This is an implementation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation. (Still in progress)
- [x] Run the algorithm on a real dataset
- [x] Implement Collapsed Gibbs Sampling
- [ ] Implement Variational Inference
- [ ] Implement Online Learning for LDA
- [ ] Implement Expectation propagation
- [ ] See what is perplexity
- [ ] Implement Belief Propagation for LDA
